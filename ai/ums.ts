/**
 * The UMS toolkit: the trigger systems a scenario runs on, built by code rather than
 * written by the model. Each *kind* — hyper triggers, a spawn cycle, kill-to-cash, lives,
 * waves, a shop, a last-standing victory… — has a catalogue entry (`SystemKindSpec`, sent
 * to the server with every design request so the model designs against what exists) and a
 * builder that turns parameters into triggers in the editor's text format, which
 * `api.triggers.text.parse` then turns into records. Tokens are spent on the creative
 * part of a map; the mechanics every madness or defense map shares are here, once, and
 * tested. Everything is pure: a builder gets a `ToolkitContext` (who the humans and
 * computers are, whether hyper triggers run, which death-counter units are free) and
 * answers text plus notes.
 *
 * Timing: without hyper triggers the game runs the trigger list about every two seconds;
 * with them, about twelve times a second. A death-counter timer counts trigger cycles, so
 * `cyclesFor(seconds)` depends on `ctx.hyper` — which is why a design that spawns every
 * few seconds must list a `hyper` system, and why the server's prompt says so.
