/**
 * The wire contract between the scmjs.dev plugin (`scm-js/plugin-scmjs-dev`) and its
 * server (`scm-js/ai-server`). One copy lives in each repository; keep them identical.
 *
 * The server is thin on purpose: it holds the Anthropic key, the prompt *recipes*, the
 * access rules and the budgets, and never any game data. Everything that makes a map a
 * map — tile ids, ISOM, placement, undo — stays in the editor. So a recipe takes the
 * facts the plugin gathered (terrain vocabulary, statistics, a rendered picture, the
 * trigger script's declarations) and returns a *plan* or *text* the plugin applies.
 *
 * Transport: `POST /v1/recipes/<name>` with a JSON `RecipeRequest`. With
 * `Accept: text/event-stream` (the plugin's default) the answer is a stream of
 * `RecipeEvent`s — `progress` heartbeats while the model thinks, `delta` text as it
 * arrives for the text recipes, one `result`, then `done`; a JSON `Accept` gets one
 * `RecipeResponse`. Errors are `ErrorBody` with the HTTP status (and, on a stream that
 * already started, an `error` event). `GET /v1/info` describes the server and the
 * caller's remaining allowance; `GET /health` is the liveness check.
 *
 * Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <access token>` for a token the operator issued, and/or
 * `X-Anthropic-Key: <key>` to bring your own Anthropic key (the server forwards it and
 * never stores it). Which of the two the server accepts is in `/v1/info`.
 *
 * Accounts (optional, `InfoResponse.accounts` says whether the server has them): the
 * bearer token may also be a *session* the server issued — `POST /v1/trial` hands one out
 * to a browser that has not had one, with a small balance and no sign-in; `POST
 * /v1/auth/start` begins a sign-in through an OAuth provider (the callback page posts the
 * session to the opener), after which the account has a one-time sign-up credit — and, on
 * a role with one, a weekly allowance — and can buy credit through `POST /v1/billing/checkout`. `GET /v1/account` is the balance and the
 * ledger; `POST /v1/auth/logout` ends the session. Every call is charged to the balance
 * at the server's price table, and `budget_exceeded` says when it is empty.
